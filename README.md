# Time Series Forecasting of Coronavirus Cases of G20 Countries

G20 countries' prediction of Covid-19 case and death numbers using Prophet algorithm

# Abstract

This project is only about predicting the last 2 weeks of Corona virus cases and deaths of G20 countries. To
do this, some Python libraries such as Pandas was used Matplotlib to plot the graph, and
Facebook Prophet to predict future cases and deaths, to retrieve and organize data.

2-week prediction was made using the number of cases from January 3, 2020 to
December 30, 2020 and the comparison with the last 2-week data was made using Rmse and
Mape error measurement metrics.

In this project, written in the Python programming language, Pandas library was used to
read and organize data, Matplotlib to graph the data and results obtained, and Facebook
Prophet to predict future cases and deaths. Facebook Prophet library was used because
it is one of the time series forecasting methods that offers the best prediction model.
